            "content": "When you compare ideas casually, the loudest idea wins. The loudest idea is usually the newest one or the one that feels exciting, not the one that will work.\n\nA selector makes the comparison fair. It forces each idea to answer the same questions using the same format. This reduces second-guessing later because you can point to the numbers and the reasons.\n\nYour selector should reward simplicity, speed, and a clear path to the first sale. You are not picking a forever business. You are picking a best next step that fits your constraints.",

            "content": "Sometimes criteria are not equally important. If your time budget is tight, delivery simplicity may matter more than price potential. If you hate marketing, reachability may matter more than novelty.\n\nWeights can help, but they also add complexity. Use weights only if you have a strong constraint that should dominate decisions. Otherwise, keep it simple and let the numbers guide you.\n\nThe main value is not the final score. The value is the forced clarity: what makes this idea good, and what makes it risky.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not score consistently, your decision will feel shaky and you will reopen it later."

            "content": "A clean decision reduces stress. You choose one primary idea and one backup. The backup is not a failure plan. It is insurance against a discovery next week, like buyers do not want this or delivery takes too long.\n\nYour decision should include a reason you can defend. I like it is not a reason. It has the fastest path to first sale and a repeatable delivery process is a reason.\n\nOnce you decide, you will treat the primary idea as the default until real evidence forces a change.",
