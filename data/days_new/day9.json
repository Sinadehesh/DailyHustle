It tells the buyer what happens after they pay, what they receive, how long it takes, and what you need from them. It also tells them what is not included.\n\nFor a small online service, the offer should be simple enough to explain in one paragraph and deliver repeatedly without reinventing the work each time.",

Clear prices and clear scope invite better customers.\n\nPackaging is your way to protect delivery. Many service offers work best as one fixed package, at least at the start. If you add options, keep them limited and meaningful, like Basic vs Plus, not five confusing tiers.\n\nA practical approach is: one core package and one add-on that is easy to deliver. This keeps your sales conversation simple.",

It is a process map your future page and messages will follow.\n\nA good buyer flow also includes proof elements. Early proof can be simple: a short checklist of what they receive, a before-after description, and a clear scope statement.",
