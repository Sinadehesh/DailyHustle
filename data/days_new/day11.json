            "content": "A service becomes stressful when you reinvent it for each customer. The fastest way to reduce stress is to pre-build the assets you will reuse: intake, templates, checklists, and a handoff format.\n\nThink of your service as a small machine. A machine has parts. If the parts are missing, you compensate with memory and extra messages, and that increases mistakes.\n\nToday you will build the minimum set of parts to run your service once. Not a full business. A deliverable kit.",

            "content": "A good intake process does two things. It collects the minimum information you need to deliver well, and it prevents mismatches before money is wasted.\n\nIntake is not a long questionnaire. It is a controlled doorway. If the customer cannot provide the right inputs, your service becomes guesswork and revisions explode.\n\nYour intake also protects you. It gives you written proof of scope, deadlines, and expectations.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not define intake clearly, your delivery will be slower and less consistent."

            "content": "Templates are not about being robotic. They are about not forgetting what matters. They let you deliver the same quality every time while still tailoring the details.\n\nFor a digital service, you need templates for the outputs and for communication. That includes a handoff document, a walkthrough format, and a message flow that prevents confusion.\n\nToday you will create a simple template set that can deliver your promise: save time and reduce frustration.",
