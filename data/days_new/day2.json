It is the idea you can actually deliver without breaking your constraints from Day 1.\n\nFeasibility is mostly logistics: time, skills, tools, and steps. If you cannot outline the first week of delivery, the idea is not ready for this 27-day sprint.\n\nThink like a small online service operator. The service should be deliverable digitally, repeatable, and simple enough to start while you are still learning. Complexity can come later if it earns the right to exist.",

Early on, your best path is usually a simple first transaction, not a long-term grand plan.\n\nA profitable idea has a buyer, a reason they pay, and a price that makes sense against effort. If you cannot see how money changes hands, you do not have an idea yet. You have a wish.\n\nKeep it grounded. In the first month, aim for small but real income, like $100 to $300. That forces clarity: how many customers, at what price, through what channel.",

It is fit between a moment and an offer.\n\nA persuasive idea can be explained quickly. It has a why now that makes sense. It reduces uncertainty by making the next step obvious: what happens after payment, what they receive, and when.\n\nFor a small online service, persuasion often comes from specificity: a clear deliverable, a tight timeframe, and a narrow problem that is common among busy people.",
