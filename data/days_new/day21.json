            "content": "Complexity shows up as extra decisions, extra messages, extra tools, and extra options. It is a tax on you and on the buyer. Buyers delay when they feel they must think too much.\n\nIn early launch, the best version of your offer is often the smallest version that still delivers the promised outcome. Fixed scope beats custom scope. One package beats three packages. One clear CTA beats multiple paths.\n\nYour goal today is not to make it cheaper. Your goal is to make it easier to buy and easier to deliver.",

Keep quality checks, but make them quick.\n\nA simple system usually has: one tracker, one payment path, one intake form, one delivery template, one follow-up rule. That is enough to sell and deliver repeatedly.\n\nToday you will implement your top cuts in the workflow and update your launch kit.",
