            "title": "Help requests work when they are specific",
            "content": "A vague request like can you share this? creates work for the helper. They have to decide who to send it to and how to describe it. Most people will postpone and forget.\n\nA good help request is narrow. It names the customer type, the problem, the offer, and the exact action you want: an introduction, a forward, or permission to mention their name.\n\nYou are not asking for a favor in the abstract. You are inviting the helper to match you with someone they already know who has the problem.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not make the ask specific, you will get polite encouragement instead of introductions."

            "id": "t2",
            "title": "Make a forwardable packet",
            "content": "Your helper should not have to write anything. You will give them a ready-made packet: a two-sentence description, one link, and one optional credibility line.\n\nForwardable text works best when it sounds like a personal note, not marketing. It should focus on the outcome and the buyer fit, not on your life story.\n\nYou will also create a short if not you, who? question to make introductions easier.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not provide a packet, your helper will delay because helping feels like writing."
        },
        {
            "id": "t3",
            "title": "Ask, track, and thank",
            "content": "A help request is a small project. You send it, you track it, you follow up once, and you say thank you. That is how you turn a favor into a repeatable channel.\n\nYou are not measuring kindness. You are measuring outcomes: intros made, forwards sent, replies received, and leads created.\n\nToday you will send your requests and record them in your tracker with follow-up dates.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not send and track the requests, your helper plan stays theoretical."
