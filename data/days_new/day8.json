            "content": "You may not have direct interviews yet. You can still create a useful model by combining three inputs: your Week 1 customer description, your Day 7 evidence, and common sense about busy people protecting time.\n\nAn imaginary conversation is not fantasy. It is a structured draft that reveals what you do not know and what you need to validate. It also forces you to write in the customer's language, not your own.\n\nThe goal is not to be right. The goal is to create a practical transcript that can be tested next week through outreach.",

            "content": "Customers rarely buy features. They buy relief, clarity, speed, and lowered risk. Your offer should use the words customers use when they explain the problem to a friend.\n\nFrom your transcript, extract phrases that describe the pain, the desired outcome, and the decision trigger. These phrases become your headline, your bullets, and your follow-up messages.\n\nAlso identify the job to be done in plain language. For busy people, it is often: help me stop wasting time on this and trust that it is handled.",

            "content": "Objections are not only barriers. They are design requirements. If the customer fears complexity, your offer must feel simple. If they fear wasted money, your offer must reduce risk with a clear scope and outcome.\n\nYou do not need to argue with objections. You need to remove the cause. That often means tighter scope, clearer deliverables, and a defined handoff.\n\nToday you will translate objections into offer decisions you will use tomorrow when you build the offer.",
