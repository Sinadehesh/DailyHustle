Batches reduce pressure and increase variety.\n\nUse three sources: your own recurring frustrations, other people's visible problems, and existing offers you can adapt. This keeps your ideas grounded in reality and payment behavior.\n\nDo not judge too early. The goal in the first pass is volume with basic fit to your filter: can it be delivered digitally, can it be sold soon, and is the benefit clear.",

You are choosing which ideas deserve more thinking tomorrow.\n\nA good candidate usually has one of these advantages: easy delivery, clear buyer pain, repeatable demand, or an obvious reason to choose you (speed, clarity, niche focus).\n\nUse simple scoring.
