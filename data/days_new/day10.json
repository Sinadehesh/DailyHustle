Your origin story should answer: why you noticed this problem, why you care, and why you can deliver a good result.\n\nThis is not a dramatic life story. It is a short explanation that makes your offer feel real. A simple, honest origin story can reduce buyer risk more than a long list of features.\n\nThink in scenes. A scene is a moment where you saw the frustration clearly: a friend overwhelmed, a repeated issue in your own life, or a pattern you observed in work.",

If you have relevant experience, mention it briefly and concretely. If not, do not invent it. Use your evidence and your design choices.\n\nA helpful credibility tool is a credibility set: three small proof points that can appear on a landing page or in a message.",

If you write them once in reusable formats, you move faster later.\n\nYou need three reusable assets: a one-sentence pitch, a short paragraph pitch, and a message you can send to a potential buyer.\n\nEach asset should reflect your customer language from Day 8 and your scope boundaries from Day 9.",
