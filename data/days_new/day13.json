            "content": "Tools feel productive because they are tangible. But tools also create overhead: logins, learning curves, subscriptions, and distractions.\n\nA lean side hustle uses as few tools as possible. Your goal is not to build a perfect stack. Your goal is to deliver the promise and get paid.\n\nA good rule is: if a tool does not reduce buyer risk, reduce delivery time, or reduce mistakes, it is optional for now.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not choose tools intentionally, you will waste money and time before you sell."

            "title": "Shopping lists need costs and exits",
            "content": "A shopping list is incomplete without cost and exit. Cost is the monthly or per-use amount. Exit is how you cancel, downgrade, or stop using it if it is not needed.\n\nAlso consider substitutes. Many paid tools can be replaced by a document template, a spreadsheet, or a free tier. You are not avoiding quality. You are avoiding complexity before revenue.\n\nToday you will build a shopping list that includes cost, alternative, and exit plan.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not include exits, small subscriptions become permanent leaks."

            "title": "Setup order matters",
            "content": "Even a lean stack becomes confusing if you set it up randomly. You need an order that matches your workflow: payment first, intake second, delivery templates third, tracking last.\n\nYou will define the smallest setup sequence that gets you to ready to sell. This prevents tool setup from becoming a never-ending project.\n\nA good setup plan also includes a time cap for each step. That keeps you moving.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not define a setup order, you will bounce between tools and finish none."
