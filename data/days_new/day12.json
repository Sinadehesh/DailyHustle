            "content": "Pricing is often treated like a magic number. In reality, pricing is a boundary that shapes who buys, what they expect, and how much time you can afford to spend.\n\nYour price must protect your delivery time. If the price is too low, you will hesitate to do careful work, or you will overwork and resent the project. Neither outcome helps the customer.\n\nA practical pricing decision includes a floor (the lowest price that still makes sense) and a target (the price you prefer). Today you will write both with assumptions.",

            "content": "Your target price should match three things: market bands, your scope boundaries, and your buyer's urgency.\n\nIf you promise fast delivery, you are selling speed and relief. That often supports a higher price than a slow, open-ended service. If you keep scope fixed, you reduce risk for yourself and for the buyer. That also supports a confident price.\n\nInstead of debating one number, create a simple price ladder: target price, backup price, and a stretch price you test later if demand is strong.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not define a price ladder, you will swing wildly between too cheap and too expensive."

            "content": "Price is not final until the market responds. That does not mean you change it daily. It means you test it with a small number of real conversations and keep notes.\n\nA clean price test has rules: how many people you ask, what you say, and what counts as a positive signal. You should also decide what you will change if the signal is weak: scope, price, or channel.\n\nToday you will write a price test plan you can run next week without overthinking.",
