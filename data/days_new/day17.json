            "content": "Publishing is not the same as building a full website. Publishing means: a buyer can read what you do, understand the scope, know the price, pay, and complete intake without confusion.\n\nYour publish surface can be one page, one post, or one listing. The format matters less than clarity. You are aiming for a clean buying path, not perfect branding.\n\nA simple online service benefits from a tight structure: who it is for, the outcome, what they get, what you need, price, timeline, and how to start. Anything else is optional.",
            "soWhat": "If your offer is not published as a complete buying path, you cannot measure real demand."

Your first goal is getting conversations with people who recognize the problem.\n\nStart with warm and adjacent networks: coworkers, friends in similar roles, small communities, alumni groups, creators you already follow, professional groups, and niche forums where your customer spends time.\n\nYour announcement should be short and direct. It should describe the outcome, the price, and the next step. If it reads like a generic ad, it will be ignored.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not announce intentionally, your offer will sit unpublished and untested."

            "content": "The moment you publish, you become a tester. Your job is to observe what happens and respond quickly. That means tracking: where you posted, who you messaged, who clicked, who replied, who asked for intake, who paid.\n\nTracking is not busywork. It is the only way to know whether you should change your opener, your scope, your price, or your channel. Most early launches fail because people do not follow up, not because the offer is bad.\n\nToday you will set up a simple launch log and publish your first version.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not track and follow up, you will confuse silence with failure and change random things."
