            "content": "You do not need advanced finance to forecast profit. You need a small set of inputs and honest assumptions.\n\nStart with units: price per sale, time per delivery, and variable costs. Then add capacity: how many sales you can deliver per week within your time budget.\n\nWhen you write these numbers down, you can compare ideas that feel similar. One idea may look exciting but collapses when you realize it needs 6 hours per customer. Another may look boring but pays well because it is repeatable and fast.",

If you have 3 hours per week and each delivery takes 90 minutes, your weekly capacity is 2 customers. That is not a judgment. It is a fact you can work with.\n\nAlso consider support time. Digital services still create questions, revisions, and follow-up. Add a small buffer so you do not lie to yourself.",

First, payback: profit per hour should beat what you could earn from an extra shift or basic freelancing. Second, simplicity: the idea should not require heavy customization to be valuable.\n\nYou are not picking a forever business. You are picking the best next step. A good week-one choice is an idea you can sell, deliver, and learn from without burning out.",
