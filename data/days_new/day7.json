            "content": "You do not need a perfect market study. You need enough clues to avoid obvious mistakes: pricing far below value, selling to the wrong people, or offering something no one buys.\n\nMarket clues are everywhere: listings, landing pages, reviews, forums, and job posts. You are not copying anyone. You are learning what customers already pay for and how they describe the problem.\n\nYour job today is to collect evidence in a consistent way so you can compare offers and extract patterns.",

Look for repeated elements: common deliverables, common timelines, common pricing bands, and common pain language.\n\nAlso note gaps. A gap is not no competitors. A gap is a mismatch, like offers that are expensive and slow, or offers that are broad and unclear. Your advantage can be clarity, speed, focus, or a better-defined outcome.\n\nYou will convert patterns into decisions: what you include, what you exclude, and where you can price without feeling dishonest.",

Today you will produce three outputs that directly shape your offer: a target price range, a scope boundary, and a channel hypothesis.\n\nA channel hypothesis is your best guess about where the first customers will come from, based on what you observed. If discussions happen on a forum, that may be your first outreach. If offers sell on marketplaces, that may be your first listing.\n\nKeep it simple. Your first customers often come from direct outreach and small communities, not from elaborate marketing.",
