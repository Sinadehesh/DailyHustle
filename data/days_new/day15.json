            "content": "A workflow is a sequence that removes decision fatigue. Instead of asking what now every time, you follow the same steps and customize only the details.\n\nYour workflow should be visible. It can be a checklist, a board, or a spreadsheet. The format matters less than the ability to track: who is in the pipeline, what step they are in, and what is next.\n\nA workflow also creates confidence. When you know the next step, outreach becomes easier because you are not afraid of the delivery.",

            "content": "A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a short, written recipe for what you do during delivery. It prevents you from skipping steps, and it makes your service easier to improve.\n\nYour SOP should include: the order of work, the quality checks, and how you handle revisions. Keep it short enough to use. If it is long, you will ignore it.\n\nToday you will create one SOP for your core package delivery.",
            "soWhat": "If you do not write an SOP, your delivery quality will depend on your mood and energy."

            "content": "Silent failure looks like: you forget to follow up, you miss a deadline, or you lose a customer's intake details. Tracking is your protection.\n\nA simple tracker should capture: customer name, status, next action, due date, payment status, and links to assets. It should also record exceptions: late intake, scope mismatch, refund request.\n\nToday you will build a tracker and an exception playbook.",
