            "content": "An obstacle is any factor that increases time, cost, or uncertainty. Naming obstacles is not negativity. It is planning.\n\nMost obstacles fall into a few buckets: unclear customer, hard delivery, hard to get attention, high competition, or too much custom work. When you label the bucket, you can choose a response.\n\nThe goal today is not to solve everything. The goal is to see the real shape of the work so you can avoid ideas that become heavy too fast.",

They are specific advantages that reduce effort or increase willingness to pay.\n\nCommon opportunities for a small online service include: repeatable demand, clear urgency windows, easy referrals, a niche where people already pay, and assets you already have (templates, skills, experience, audience).\n\nIf you can name opportunities clearly, you can design the offer to use them. For example, if urgency peaks weekly, you can sell a weekly reset service. If referrals are natural, you can build a referral ask into delivery.",

Examples: write a one-paragraph offer and see if someone replies, post a simple form and see if anyone fills it, or run a 10-minute call with a friend to test clarity (only if calls fit your constraints).\n\nToday you will decide what you can test next week, and what you should avoid entirely.",
