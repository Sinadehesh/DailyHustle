  "about": {
    "title": "Why This Course Exists",
    "content": [
      "Most people have at least one side hustle idea floating in their head. Maybe it's a service they could offer, a product they could create, or a skill they could monetize. The problem isn't lack of ideas—it's lack of a clear path from idea to income.",
      "I created Side Hustle: 27-Day Launch because I've seen too many smart, capable people stay stuck in the 'thinking about it' phase for months or even years. They read books, listen to podcasts, and research endlessly—but never actually ship anything.",
      "This program is different. It's not about inspiration or motivation. It's a structured operating system that walks you through exactly what to do each day. Open the day, complete the mission, fill out the workbook, move on.",
      "By Day 27, you'll have: a validated idea, a defined offer, a pricing strategy, a published way to buy, and real feedback from the market. That's the goal—not theory, but tangible progress you can measure."
