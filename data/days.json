Commitment unlocks energy. Hesitation drains it.\n\nYou will use a five-factor system to rank your ideas:\n\nFeasibility. Can you actually do this with your current skills, time, and resources? An idea you cannot execute is not an idea. It is a fantasy.\n\nProfitability. Does the math work? Can you sell this at a price that leaves meaningful profit after costs and your time?\n\nPersuasion. Is there a clear reason to buy now? Does this solve a problem that feels urgent or painful? Can you explain it in one sentence?\n\nEfficiency. How fast can you launch and test? Ideas that require months of prep before you can get feedback are dangerous for part-time hustlers.\n\nMotivation. How excited are you? You will need to push through hard moments. If you feel nothing, that matters.\n\nScore each idea on these five factors. Add the scores. Rank them. Then pick your primary and backup.\n\nYour primary idea is the one you commit to for the next seven days. Your backup is the fallback if something fundamental breaks. Everything else gets shelved. You can return to those ideas later if needed.\n\nDo not overthink the scoring. Use your gut combined with what you learned on Days 1 through 5.

If people are already paying for something similar, there is a market. The absence of competition usually means the absence of buyers, not untapped opportunity.\n\nHere is what you are looking for:\n\nWhat do competitors offer? Study the specifics. What is included, what is not, how is it priced, how is it delivered?\n\nWhat do customers complain about? Read reviews, comments, and forum threads. Complaints are opportunities. Each frustration is a chance to do something better or different.\n\nWhat is missing? Sometimes no one offers exactly what a segment wants. That gap is your angle.\n\nYour goal is not to be the best in the world. That is unrealistic and unnecessary. Your goal is to be different enough that you have a reason to exist. You need a clear answer to: why would someone choose you instead of the others?\n\nThe answer might be: you are faster, cheaper, more personal, more specialized, local, or more trustworthy. Any angle works if it is true and you can deliver on it.\n\nBy the end of today, you will have a short statement: I am different because _____. That statement guides everything you build."

            "content": "You have an idea, an avatar, an offer, and a story. Now you need a place to put it all. Today is about logistics, not creativity.\n\nThe goal is a setup spine: the minimum operational pieces required to launch. Nothing fancy. Nothing polished. Just the essentials that let you accept money and deliver value.\n\nHere is what a basic spine looks like:\n\n1. A place to explain the offer. This could be a simple landing page, a Google Doc, or even a well-written email. The format matters less than clarity. Can someone read it and understand what they get?\n\n2. A way to capture interest. An email address to contact you, a form to fill out, or a DM button. Make it easy for interested people to raise their hand.\n\n3. A delivery method. How does the customer receive what they paid for? A file sent by email? A scheduling link for a call? A shipped package? Know the mechanism.\n\n4. A basic agreement. What you will do, how much it costs, and when they pay. This does not need to be a legal contract. It can be three lines in an email. Clarity protects both parties.\n\n5. A support channel. An email address where customers can reach you if something goes wrong.\n\nThat is the spine. Everything else is optional for now.\n\nConsider Sarah, who wanted to launch a meal planning service. She spent three weeks designing a logo and perfecting her Instagram grid. Meanwhile, her friend Jake wrote a one-page Google Doc explaining his offer, added a PayPal link, and got two paying customers in a week. Jake had a spine. Sarah had decoration.\n\nMake it easier: Start with what you already have. A free Carrd page. A simple Notion doc. Your existing email address. You can upgrade later when you have revenue.\n\nCommon mistake: Overbuilding before validation. You do not need a custom website, a full brand package, or automated workflows to make your first sale. You need clarity and a way to get paid."

            "content": "Many people skip this step or guess at random. They pick a number that sounds nice or copy a competitor without thinking. That is how you end up resenting your own hustle.\n\nToday you will use a simple cost-plus approach to find your minimum workable price. Then you will choose a starting price within a realistic range.\n\nFor services:\n\nStart by estimating how many hours it takes to deliver. Be realistic. Include prep time, communication, and follow-up. Multiply by the minimum hourly value you are willing to accept. Then add any direct costs like software or materials. That is your floor.\n\nFor products:\n\nStart with your unit cost: materials, production, packaging. Add shipping and platform fees. Then add the minimum profit you need per sale. That is your floor.\n\nNow look at the range. Your floor is the bottom. Your ceiling is what the market will bear. Somewhere in between is your starting price.\n\nThree common pricing models:\n\nFlat package: One price for a defined scope. Works well when you can predict effort.\n\nHourly: Charge for time. Works when scope varies or customers want flexibility.\n\nTiered options: Good, better, best. Gives customers choice and anchors them to the middle.\n\nConsider Marcus, who offered resume writing. He charged 25 dollars because he felt nervous. Each resume took him 3 hours. He was earning less than minimum wage and started dreading the work. When he raised his price to 75 dollars, he attracted better clients and enjoyed the process. Underpricing creates hidden damage.\n\nPrice sanity check: If you sell 5 units this month, are you happy? If you sell 50, can you deliver? If either answer is no, adjust.\n\nCommon mistake: Pricing based on fear instead of value. Your price should cover your costs, respect your time, and leave room to improve the offer."

Improving the deliverable, clarifying the promise, simplifying onboarding. Anything that makes the customer's experience better.\n\n2. Increasing income for you. Sending outreach, publishing the offer, asking for referrals, following up with leads. Anything that directly leads to money in your account.\n\nThe 10 percent rule: Find 30 minutes in your day. Add 3 extra minutes to benefit tasks and 3 extra minutes to income tasks. That is 10 percent more on the work that matters.\n\nThe morning 25-minute block: Before distractions hit, spend 25 minutes on one focused build session. Do not check email. Do not browse. Just build or sell.\n\nDecision rule: If the task does not improve benefit or income, pause it. You can return to it after launch. Right now, focus.\n\nExamples of high-impact actions:\n\nBenefit: Record a quick tutorial video, write clearer instructions, add a checklist for customers.\n\nIncome: Send 3 outreach messages, post your offer publicly, email past contacts, ask a happy customer for a referral.\n\nExamples of low-value tasks to stop:\n\nPerfecting your logo. Reorganizing your folder structure. Reading one more book about business. Waiting for the perfect moment.\n\nCommon mistake: Confusing busy with productive.

The hardest sale is the first one; subsequent sales to satisfied customers are much easier."
