    "courseOrientation": "This course works best when you treat it like a short daily work sprint. Each day follows the same rhythm: read a little, do the work, submit what you produced, then stop. Do not keep going to make it perfect. The point is momentum and evidence, not polish.\n\nYou will often act before you feel fully ready. That is intentional. Readiness usually shows up after you start, not before. In this course, decisions are small and reversible. You are not marrying an idea. You are moving it from foggy to concrete fast enough to learn what is real.\n\nUse the workbook as a decision log, not a diary. A diary records feelings. A decision log records choices, assumptions, numbers, and next actions. When you look back later, you should be able to answer: What did I decide, and why? What did I assume? What evidence did I collect? What will I do next?\n\nProgress is simple. Every DO checkbox represents a real output you created. When you check it, you should have something you can paste, link, or show: a sentence, a list, a price guess, a mini plan, a cost estimate. No checkboxes for motivation, confidence, or understanding. If it did not produce an artifact, it does not count.\n\nTime expectations: plan for 25 to 45 minutes per day. Most days are three short work blocks. If you only have 25 minutes, do the first two DO blocks and finish the third later the same day. If you have 45 minutes, keep the pace calm and write clearly. Your job is to produce usable drafts that can be improved later.",

            "name": "Week 1 - Build an Arsenal of Ideas",
            "introduction": "This week is about volume and structure. You will generate ideas on purpose, then shape them into a form you can compare. The goal is not to find the one perfect idea. The goal is to build an arsenal and learn to judge ideas quickly.\n\nBy the end of this week, you will have:\n- A clear 27-day target and constraints that guide your choices\n- Three to five well-described side hustle ideas with basic scores and notes\n- A simple profit forecast for your best candidates, with assumptions written down\n\nHow to pace it:\n- Do one day per calendar day if you can, but do not rush the writing\n- Keep every output short and specific. One paragraph beats one page\n- Save everything in one place so you can reuse it next week\n\nCommon trap to avoid: Many people try to think their way into certainty. They research endlessly, or they try to design the perfect business before they have even chosen a customer and a price. This week, you will do the opposite: create small, testable definitions and numbers, then use them to narrow down."

        "2": {
            "name": "Week 2 - Select Your Best Idea",
            "introduction": "This week turns your best-looking ideas into a clear choice you can build. You will stop treating ideas as equal and start treating them as candidates that must earn their place through evidence, clarity, and a believable first sale.\n\nBy the end of this week, you will have:\n- One primary side hustle idea and one backup, chosen with written reasons and evidence\n- A clear picture of your ideal customer's situation, language, and buying triggers\n- A simple, sellable offer: scope, deliverables, price, and a short origin story\n\nHow to pace it:\n- Work from your saved Week 1 artifacts, not from memory, and update them as you go\n- Keep each output short and specific, then move to the next step\n- When you find new information, write it as evidence, not as a new plan\n\nCommon trap to avoid: Many people mistake more options for progress. They keep generating new ideas to avoid committing to one. This week is the opposite. You will use structured comparison and real-world clues to narrow down, even if it feels uncomfortable. The goal is not perfect certainty. The goal is a smart choice you can execute."

        "3": {
            "name": "Week 3 - Prepare for Liftoff",
            "introduction": "This week is about operational readiness. You already have a chosen idea and a clear offer. Now you will build the small system that lets you deliver reliably, charge confidently, and avoid chaos when the first customer says yes.\n\nBy the end of this week, you will have:\n- A complete delivery toolkit: templates, intake, boundaries, and a repeatable handoff\n- A pricing decision you can defend, plus a simple plan to test and adjust it\n- A working payment flow and a first workflow that tracks leads, delivery, and follow-up\n\nHow to pace the week:\n- Do not aim for perfect tools. Aim for good enough to sell and deliver once.\n- Build the smallest version first, then add only what reduces risk or saves time.\n- Keep every artifact in one place so you can reuse it without hunting.\n\nCommon trap to avoid: Many people treat preparation as a reason to delay selling. They build elaborate websites, chase the best software, or rewrite copy endlessly. This week, preparation is only allowed if it reduces uncertainty, reduces delivery time, or reduces buyer risk. If it does not do one of those, it is optional and should wait."

        "4": {
            "name": "Week 4 - Launch Your Idea to the Right People",
            "introduction": "This week is about shipping and selling in a simple, direct way. You will stop polishing in private and start putting your offer in front of real people who can say yes, no, or not now. That feedback is the fuel. It tells you what to change and what to keep.\n\nBy the end of this week, you will have:\n- A published offer page or listing that clearly explains scope, price, intake, and next steps\n- A repeatable outreach system: scripts, follow-up rules, and a simple tracker\n- Real market signals: replies, objections, click behavior, intake requests, and ideally your first paid order\n\nHow to pace the week:\n- Do small launches daily rather than one big launch at the end.\n- Keep your publish surface minimal: one page, one payment path, one intake path.\n- Spend most of your time on contact and follow-up, not on design tweaks.\n\nCommon trap to avoid: Many people treat launch week like marketing week, which becomes post something and hope. That is passive and slow. This week is about active contact and controlled testing. You will ask clearly, track outcomes, and adjust based on evidence, not mood."
